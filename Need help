About the project..

The basis of this idea lay experiences of many people... it is Possible that each person in life there were situations when some important aspect in good human relationship was lost...and the possibility that it will happen again, no.
We are talking about random encounters with good and nice people, interlocutors, fellow travelers, people that would like to meet again. But due to various reasons, such as lack of phone numbers, addresses, and often even name these people, unfortunately not remembered or at the time it is considered useful to clarify some information so as not to seem Intrusive.
The same can be said about the random transport, in the street or anywhere else. When exchanged a pleasant glance or smile, and take a hesitant or find it unnecessary "to impose",and then regret his indecision...
More can be said about all sorts of random grievances or frustrations that we often deliver to each other not on purpose, but to apologize then is not possible, all not enough time or the courage to say the words of apology...And no matter it is a close person or a chance meeting in this world...
It to be able to find a person with whom you met by chance and would like to meet again, and as a way to apologize to the other person regardless of how much time has passed since the meeting but the heart is the need to say "I'm sorry", and created this page, where a letter may read the one addressed to whom.... and because this page is the Internet accessible to all. 
I really hope that we all have something to say to each other sincerely kind and good to add warmth to simple human relationships...the Project is about finding a man




Need help in the realization of this idea, namely in programming, in the creation of applications ( social networks, software for Android, etc.) of any format.......the main thing that this idea has become useful for people....
